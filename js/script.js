 * Concatenating (Combing Strings) Created by Phirom Yim on 4/13/14.

//two or more strings you need to combine
var firsName = "Phirom";
var lastName = "Yim";
var fullName = firstName + " " +LastName;

//using concatenation to add space between name

console.log (fullName);

var a = "6";//concatenating into a string
var b = "7";

var result = a + b; //concatenate doesn't add var but instead combines
console.log(result);//concatenating gives a string of "67" and not the number 13
